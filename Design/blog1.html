            <h2>Some of the vegan protein sources</h2> <br><br>

            <h2>1. Seitan</h2>
            <h4><p>Seitan is a popular protein source for many vegetarians and vegans.

                It’s made from gluten, the main protein in wheat. Unlike many soy-based mock meats, it closely resembles the look and texture of meat when cooked.
                
                Also known as wheat meat or wheat gluten, it contains about 25 grams of protein per 3.5 ounces (100 grams), making it one of the richest plant protein sources available.
                Seitan is also a good source of selenium and contains small amounts of iron, calcium, and phosphorus.
                
                You can find this meat alternative in the refrigerated section of many grocery stores, especially at health food stores. You can also make your own version with vital wheat gluten.
                
                Seitan can be pan-fried, sautéed, and even grilled, making it easy to incorporate into a variety of recipes.
                
                However, because it contains wheat, people with gluten-related disorders should avoid eating seitan.
            </p></h4><br><br>

            <h2>2. Tofu, tempeh, and edamame</h2>
            <h4><p>Tofu, tempeh, and edamame all originate from soybeans and are especially popular in East Asian cuisine.

                Soybeans are considered a whole source of protein. This means that they provide your body all the essential amino acids it needs.
                
                Edamame are immature soybeans with a sweet and slightly grassy taste. They need to be steamed or boiled before you eat them. Then, they can be enjoyed on their own or added to soups, salads, sushi, wraps, stir-fries, or rice rolls.
                
                Tofu is made from bean curds pressed together in a process similar to cheesemaking. Meanwhile, tempeh is made by cooking and slightly fermenting mature soybeans, then pressing them into a block.
                
                Tofu doesn’t have much taste on its own, but it easily absorbs the flavor of the ingredients it’s prepared with. Comparatively, tempeh has a characteristic nutty flavor.
                
                Both tofu and tempeh can be used in a variety of recipes, ranging from burgers to soups, stews, curries, and chilis.
            </p></h4><br><br>

            <h2>3. Lentils</h2>
            <h4><p>With 18 grams of protein per cooked cup (198 grams), lentils are a great source of protein.

                They can be used in a variety of dishes, ranging from fresh salads to hearty soups and spice-infused dahls.
                
                Lentils are also a great source of fiber, providing over half of your recommended daily fiber intake in a single cup (198 grams).
                
                Furthermore, the type of fiber found in lentils has been shown to feed the good bacteria in your colon, which can help promote a healthy gut. Lentils may also reduce your chance of heart disease, diabetes, excess body weight, and certain types of cancer.
                
                In addition, lentils are rich in folate, manganese, and iron. They also contain a hearty dose of antioxidants and other health-promoting plant compounds.
                
                Lentils are popular around the globe, and they’re the basis of Indian dishes known as dal or dahl. If you eat South Asian food often, chances are you’re already a fan of lentils.
            </p></h4><br><br>

            <h2>4. Beans</h2>
            <h4><p>Kidney, black, pinto, and most other varieties of beans are extremely important staple foods across cultures and contain high amounts of protein per serving.

                Chickpeas, also known as garbanzo beans, are another type of bean with a high protein content.
                
                Most types of beans contain about 15 grams of protein per cooked cup (170 grams). They’re also excellent sources of complex carbs, fiber, iron, folate, phosphorus, potassium, manganese, and several beneficial plant compounds
               
                Moreover, several studies show that a diet rich in beans and other legumes can help decrease cholesterol levels, manage blood sugar, lower blood pressure, and even reduce belly fat.

                Add beans to your diet by making a tasty bowl of homemade chili, or enjoy extra health benefits by sprinkling a dash of turmeric on roasted chickpeas.   
            </p></h4><br><br>

            <h2>5. Green peas</h2>
            <h4><p>Green peas contain nearly 9 grams of protein per cooked cup (160 grams), which is slightly more than a cup (237 mL) of dairy milk.

                What’s more, a serving of green peas covers more than 25% of your daily fiber, thiamine, folate, manganese, and vitamin A, C, and K needs.
                
                Green peas are also a good source of iron, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, copper, and several other B vitamins.
                
                You can use peas in recipes such as pea-and-basil-stuffed ravioli, Thai-inspired pea soup, or pea-and-avocado guacamole.
            </p></h4><br><br>

            <h2>6. Oats and oatmeal</h2>
            <h4><p>Eating oats is an easy and delicious way to add protein to any diet.

                Half a cup (40 grams) of dry oats provides approximately 5 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber. Oats also contain magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, and folate.
                
                Although oats are not considered a complete protein, they do contain higher quality protein than other commonly consumed grains like rice and wheat.
                
                You can use oats in a variety of recipes ranging from oatmeal to veggie burgers. They can also be ground into flour and used for baking.</p></h4>
